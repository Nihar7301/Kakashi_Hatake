    <h1>Hi, Myself Kakashi Hatake</h1>
    <p>
    I am from the town of Konoha and the only non-uchiha to get the sharingan which was gifted to me by my childhood friend Obito Uchiha. I became the 6th Hokage of the Leaf Village then i retired and gave the chance to become Hokage to Naruto Uzumaki my student. I am the son of The White Fang. I lost all my comrades in the 3rd Shinobi war but i am still strong and never lose hope. I was the leader of team seven which includes Naruto Uzumaki , Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha. This was the strongest team I ever had and this team makes me feel proud. All my teammates are best in their own fields now.I hope my teacher Minato Uzumaki would be proud of me. He was the fourth Hokage of Leaf village.
